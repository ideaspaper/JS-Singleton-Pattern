# Singleton Pattern

This repo is an example on how to create singleton pattern with JavaScript.
Since singleton class needs its constructor to be private, we cannot implement this in pure JavaScript.
We cannot add `#` in constructor method of a class.
Therefore, in this example we will utilize JSDoc and TypeScript's type checking feature.
